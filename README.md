This repository is for the Rummy Tile Game Iteration 1 project.

This repository is created 1 week before the due date, after I noticed a team member plagiarized in the commits. 

This repository only contains the structure of the project. One can not run the game with these code. This repository has been merged, and the iteration has been completed in the main repository. 

For the completed project (After Iteration 2), I will modify the commit by removing the plagiarized parts, and may open to public later.

The requirements of this project include (But not limit to):
1. Build a Rummy Tile Game in Java by practising Agile method and TDD approach. 
2. The Game should include 4 player, 1 human player and 3 AIPlayers. 
3. The 3 AIPlayers should apply different strategies (pre defined). 
4. Using template or strategy design pattern for the AIPlayers. 
5. Using observor design pattern for the AIPlayers
6. The game should have a GUI interface, applying MVC design pattern . 
7. A test mode should be included in the game, to test AI Player's strategies (Decorator design pattern was used here)
8. When the Human Player played invalid tiles, the tiles on the table should restored to the previous valid patterns, and the player has to be punished by draw extra tiles (Memento design pattern was used here). 

A link contains the video clips of the game will be added later.
